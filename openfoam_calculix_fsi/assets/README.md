# Assets Directory

This directory contains additional utilities for the FSI environment:

- `frdToVTKConverter.exe`: Utility to convert CalculiX FRD results to VTK format
- `unical3`: Linux utility for CalculiX processing

These files should be placed in this directory alongside the setup_cfd.sh script.
